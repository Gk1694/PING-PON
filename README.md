<h2>About ping pong </h2>
<p>Ping Pong, also known as table tennis, is a popular indoor sport played by two or four players who hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small paddles.</p>

<p>The game originated in England in the late 19th century, and has since become a popular recreational activity, as well as an Olympic sport.</p>

<p>The rules of Ping Pong are fairly simple. Each player takes turns serving the ball, and the point is awarded to the player who fails to return the ball back over the net. The first player to score 11 points (or 21 in some variations) wins the game, and the match is typically played as the best of five or seven games.</p>

<p>Ping Pong requires a combination of hand-eye coordination, agility, and strategy, making it a challenging and engaging sport for players of all ages and skill levels. It also has a number of health benefits, including improving reflexes, coordination, and mental focus, as well as providing a good cardiovascular workout.</p>
